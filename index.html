            <h1>Why Visit Hunza Valley? </h1>
            
            <p>
                After traveling all over Pakistan (in addition to numerous other countries) there’s nowhere quite as beautiful or magical as Hunza, where you’ll be surrounded by 6 and 7000 meter peaks as far as the eye can see.

The culture is warm and unique, and the local cuisine and languages are unlike anything you’ll find in mainland Pakistan. 

Even if the thought of visiting Pakistan scares you, rest assured that Hunza is a unicorn of sorts. It’s always been peaceful, it’s very liberal, and highly educated. 

Combine all that together and you have an adventure traveler’s dream. No Pakistan itinerary is complete without at LEAST a week spent in Hunza. 
            </p>

                    <p>The majestic Altit Fort is several hundred years old
                        Altit Fort (Urdu: قلعہ التیت) is an ancient fort in the Altit town in the Hunza valley in Gilgit Baltistan, Pakistan. It was originally home to the hereditary rulers of the Hunza state who carried the title of 'Mir', although they moved to the somewhat younger Baltit fort nearby three centuries later.

The Hotel is maximum 20 minutes drive away from Karimabad town. A 6 kilometers metal road leads from Karimabad town to the Hotel's parking.</p>

                    <p>The icy-blue Attabad Lake is now the most famous place to visit in Hunza, but don’t forget its dark past. The lake only came into existence in 2010 when a massive landslide buried villages and killed many.

                        The landslide blocked the Hunza River, thus creating what is now one of the most beautiful lakes of Pakistan.</p>

                    <p>At 4693 meters above sea level, Pakistan’s border with China is the highest paved crossing in the world!

                        It should only take about 2 hours from Passu, and in that time you’ll get to drive through the stunning Khunjerab National Park. The national park itself is home to plenty of wildlife, including yaks, marmots and various types of birds.
                        
                        If you’re really lucky, you might even get to spot a Himalayan ibex, or even more rare: the elusive snow leopard.
                        
                        As there’s nowhere to stay in or around the border, you’ll want to aim to spend the night in Aliabad or Karimabad for easy access to tomorrow’s itinerary.</p>

                    <p>This is no doubt one of my favorite villages in Pakistan, thanks to its majestic views and delicious food!

                        After admiring the cones, drive a bit further to check out the newly constructed Rainbow Bridge. If you don’t mind a short hike, you can also head toward the Passu Glacier, though it’s best accessed from Borith Lake.
                        
                        Enjoy some afternoon chai at Glacier Breeze, which is known for its famous apricot cake, before ending the night at the Yak Grill, which serves up the best burger you’ll ever eat in your life.</p>

                    <h3>DAY 4-Passu Glacier</h3>
                    <p>Walking on the pristine white Passu Glacier (which is actually best accessed from Borith Lake) is one of my favorite things to do in Hunza. Especially if you’ve never seen a glacier before as was the case with me, just prepare to be awed and thank me later! 

                        If you don’t have any trekking experience, taking a local guide with you is a good idea. It’s also important to start early, as the glacier starts to melt come mid day.
                        
                        Keep in mind that this activity requires some degree of agility and physical fitness–there are NO HORSES, and it’s not suitable for children.</p>

                        The famous Hussaini Suspension Bridge can be found in Hussaini Village, which is right on the Karakoram Highway some 10-15 minutes north of Gulmit.
                        
                        Locals have used the bridge forever, as it connects to a summer settlement called Zarabad. These days, a zipline has also been installed, and a small fee is required to cross.</p>

            <h5>Daily Budget in Hunza</h5>
           <p>If you’re wondering about Hunza Valley trip costs, the answer is that it can be as expensive or as cheap as you want it to be.

            Luxurious hotels with western prices can be found virtually everywhere, but quality budget abodes are hard to find.
            
            Although Hunza has delicious local cuisine, most restaurants are run primarily by outsiders serving very subpar Pakistani food, though some of it is decent and cheap.</p>

            <h2>Hunza Valley People & Culture</h2>
        
       
                
                <p>Hunza Valley’s culture is incredibly unique and beautiful. I always tell people that visiting Hunza is like traveling to a new country: it couldn’t be more different from mainland Pakistan if it tried.

                    First off, the majority of Hunza people are Ismaili Muslims, which is known as one of the most liberal sects of Islam. Ismailis do NOT pray 5 times a day, and instead of mosques, they worship at Jammat Khanas, which are commonly referred to as community centers.
                    
                    Unlike in other sects of Islam, both women and men pray at the Jammat Khana, and Hunza women are involved in all aspects of public life.</p>
                <p>Imam Prince Aga Khan is the current spiritual leader of Ismailis, and has brought incredible infrastructure and educational developments to Hunza as well as Pakistan as a whole. The best hospital (and associated medical school) in the entire country is in fact called Aga Khan.

                    The people of Hunza are also incredibly hospitable, and are known for their calm, warm demeanor.</p>
                <p>You’ll also find numerous unique festivals in Hunza, including the ancient Tagham which celebrates the coming of spring in Shimshal.</p>
